This Flask application facilitates users in creating, managing, and accessing notes and media. For a straightforward deployment within your local network, modify the run code by setting the host to '0.0.0.0'. Subsequently, access the application from another device through the provided URL, enabling seamless content sharing. It is crucial to note that, as of now, the application employs the less secure HTTP protocol, exposing it to potential cybersecurity risks. Therefore, it is recommended to confine its usage within a private, isolated network. The default access password is set to 'clipluck-bee'. Enjoy the functionality and features of the application!
